Welcome to O Town.

This blog reflects my journey through the [Dev Academy Bootcamp](https://devacademy.co.nz/). I will be covering topics ranging from Web Development to the deep mysterious life of [Oscar](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/files/2014/08/Oscar.jpg).

I hope you stick around and learn something new
