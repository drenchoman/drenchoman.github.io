          <ul class="blog-list">
            <li>I value hard work and failure. I value action over rhetoric.</li>
            <li>I value health and fitness. I value a healthy body and mind.</li>
            <li>I value community and the individual.</li>
            <li>I value trust. I value skin in the game. I value hopes and dreams.</li>
            <li>I value critical thinking. I value pause.</li>
            <li>I value slow growth, improvement over time.</li>
            <li>I value minimalism. I value learning and humility.</li>
            <li>I value friendships. I value the Earth and the Environment.</li>
            <li>I value experimentation. I value conversation.</li>
            <li>I value optimism and realism. I value shared principles and a common goal</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Perhaps what we value, isn't always what we have. 
            It is an aspiration, a goal to be achieved, something we can strive for.

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">An ethical decision</h3>
          <p>One decision that springs to mind recently was around vaccination and the COVID-19 pandemic. When the vaccine was announced I was quite skeptical as it had been developed in such a short time frame.
            I did not know what to do, whether to take it or not. It can be hard to think back to that time because it was all so much.
          </p>
          <p>Ultimately I decided to have the vaccine and I ended up being very involved in NZ's vaccination efforts, being an Admin as part of the Outreach vaccination team.
          </p>
          <p>I did this because I value trust, community and health. The benefits of having a vaccine aligned with my values and we ultimately have to trust one another to make things work. Division is not helpful, shared principles and a common goal is needed and I think NZ really got behind the vaccination drive.</p>
          <p>It has been quite a divisive issue but I think I made the right decision at the time and I stand by my decision.</p>
          
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h3>
          <p>I was raised in a Christian household. My parents were not overtly religious but my sisters were more in touch with their religion and encouraged me to go to youth group.</p>
           <p>Through youthgroup I came to value community, friendship, faith and courage. I also embodied the Protestant work ethic of <strong>hard work, thrift and efficiency</strong> which served me well throughout Highschool, Uni and life today.</p>
          <p>I drifted away from religion as I entered my 20's. Only after reflection did I appreciate the values mentioned above.</p>
          <p>Chruch can bring people together. You can have completely different backgrounds but have a shared belief in God. Shared values unite and enable. Faith enables you to try. Faith gives hope. Faith is optimisim in the face of a world that doesn't care.
            </p>

             <blockquote>We are what we repeatedly do, excellence then, is not an act but a habit.
               </blockquote>
             </div>
          <p>Throughout my early 20's I explored (and continue to explore) other ways of looking at the world. I am particularly fond of the Existentialists (Satre, Camus, Kierkegaard) as I think they way have got it right in terms of the meaning of life and how to view the world.</p>
          <p>Their conclusions, generally speaking, is that the world is unblinking, it does not care about you, it doesn't have the capacity to care about you, there is no inherent meaning to the world.
          <p>Some can see this as pessimistic and a very bleak outlook on the world but in fact it can be quite liberating.
            If their is no inherent meaning, if existence preceeds essence, then we are free to make our own meaning.</p>
          <p> We can find humour in the absurdity of the world, draw our own conclusions and live freely.
            Our anxietys are an invitation to freedom and not just a symptom to be eliminated or cured. </p>
          <p>Their are no clear guidelines in this life but we ultimately have the freedom to take action and be responsible for our actions</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">My Strengths</h3>
          <ul class="blog-list">
            <li>I can be focused.</li>
            <li>If I have a clear goal I will pursue it with every part of my being.</li>
            <li>I am a hard-worker.</li>
            <li>I am a problem-solver</li>
            <li>I am a good learner</li>
            <li>I keep an open mind</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">How this may help in my learning journey</h3>
            <p>I think these strengths will have me to persevere even in the face of great difficulty.
              If I don't understand a problem I will take every step to understand and then solve the issue.</p>
            <p>I should also keep an open mind to anything I might learn and think about how what I learn can be used in a practical way, to look at the bigger picture.
              Any barrier I face, I should remain focused, not wander and try my hardest to solve the issue at hand.</p>
              
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">My limitations</h3>
          <ul class="blog-list">
            <li>I have trouble sharing my ideas</li>
            <li>I am interested in too many things, never going into depth into anything</li>
            <li>I can struggle to focus sometimes if I am not interested in something</li>
            <li>I dislike being forced into doing something.</li>
            <li>My mind can wander.</li>
            <li>I am quite reserved which makes me appear snobby, rude and unfriendly.</li>
            <li>I can be unintentionally brash</li>
          </ul>

           <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Trying to work productively</h3>
           <p>One time when I was working at Vodafone in the retail store there was a customer that was having an issue with their phone plan.
            They were angry as Vodafone was "stealing" their credit when they topped up. They were rude and would interupt whenever I would attempt to explain what was going on.
            They were resistant to any explanation.</p>
            <p>Eventually I was able to get them to stop and breathe.
              Taking their emotions into account, I was able to carefully explain the situation.</p>
            <p>When they topped up, the plan was being bought which reduced their account balance to 0. They didnt understand that they were actually purchasing texts, minutes and data. 
                I made sure they understood by writing down a clear diagram on paper of what was happening- just something simple so they could see visually what was happening, that their top up was buying a plan and that it wasn't just going down to $0 for no reason.
            </p>
            <p>Once I solved their issue, and explained in a way they understood, they were much happier and conversational. It made me happy to see their demeanor change in such a short amount of time.</p>
            <p>While this was a relatively minor issue, it showed me the importance of clear and concise communication.
              It also taught me to take a persons feelings into account, I could tell they were completely frustrated with what was happening.
              I was able to calm them down and explain in a way that they understood.
              Sometimes there is not a clear cut answer, like there was in this situation. If that is the case, we still need to find some agreement and make compromise if need be but first we must understand eachothers perspective.</p>
            <h4>Ultimately I learnt</h4>
            <ul class="blog-list">
              <li>To first understand the problem and the emotional situation.</li>
              <li>Once the issue is understood, work together to solve the issue</li>
              <li>When a solution is found, explain in a way which takes emotions into account. Being careful not to appear too rude or condescending.</li>
              <li>Ensure the person is satisfied with the resolution, has anything been missed? Does the person understand? Has agreement been made?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't move on until the other person understands. If it is resolved but they don't understand, they may still feel as if you are wrong.</p>
