          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to <strong>perceive, control and evaluate</strong> your own emotions as well as those of others. </p>
          <p>People with high EQ are able to <strong>understand, interpret and respond</strong> to the emotions of others because they can better understand how the <strong>other person is feeling</strong>.</p>
          <p>One way that we can perceive or understand someones emotions is by paying attention to their <strong>non-verbal communications</strong>. This could be through their body language or facial expressions.
            Those with a high EQ would be able to read these gestures and <strong>connect and relate in a more deeper, encompassing way</strong>.
            </p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">How is it different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>Intelligence Quotient or IQ is a measure of what someone knows and how quickly they can <strong>solve problems using reasoning</strong>.</p>
          <p>It is the ability to use logic to solve problems, plan & strategise, understand abstract ideas and learn and adapt to change.</p>
          <p>The differences between IQ and EQ are pretty stark. While IQ may help us solve complex problems, EQ helps us to work with others, understand emotion and use <strong>social cohesion to problem solve</strong>.</p>
          <p>One is not necessarily better than the other. Success at anything will generally require both.</p>
          <p>The good news is that both are able to be train and developed so if you feel you are lacking in one aspect, have hope, you can learn and become better.</p>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Why is it important?</h3>
          <p>EQ is important as it can develop us into a more <strong>well rounded person </strong> who is better able to work, understand and collaborate with others.</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Understanding ourselves</h4>
          <p>EQ helps us to better understand ourselves through our emotions. It can help us to understand why we may be feeling a particular way. And as we begin to understand ourselves we begin to understand others and why they might be feeling a particular way.</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Understanding others</h4>
          <p>EQ helps us to build our empathy for others. We can understand how others are feeling and consider how we would feel in a similar situation.</p>
          <p>Empathy can lead to understanding and connection which makes <strong>communication and collaboration easier</strong>.</p>

           </div>
           <p>To achieve great things we must understand eachother and work together. Enhancing our EQ can help us become more understanding of one another as well as ourselves.</p>
