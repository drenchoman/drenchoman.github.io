          <p>Before I tell you my approach to problem solving, let me tell you about a time I was stuck on a simple problem.</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">The Problem</h4>
          <p>I was working on the <a href="https://replit.com/@drenchoman/Super-FizzBuzz#index.js">Super Fizz Buzz Challenge</a> and it was working okay...ish but I had one small issue. My code was converting the number to "Fizz" but also returning the number (3) afterwards aswell.</p>
          <div class="blog-image-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-image" src="../assets/images/problem.JPG" alt="FizzBuzz Problem">
            <span>My function returning the number in addition to "Fizz".</span>
          </div>
          <p>I didn't understand why my code wasn't working. I tried console logging, talking through my problem and googling.</p>
          <div class="blog-image-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-image" src="../assets/images/nonworkingcode.JPG" alt="FizzBuzz Code not working.">
            <span>My non-working code.</span>
          </div>
          <p>I felt frustrated. I wanted to flip a table and say mean things about my abilities, why doesn't this work!</p>
          <div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:71%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/Pch8FiF08bc1G" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/Pch8FiF08bc1G">via GIPHY</a></p>
          <p>Eventually I stumbled on the answer. I didn't <strong>have an else statement</strong>.</p>
          <p>I added the else statement and <em>voil√†</em> it was working perfectly.</p>
          <div class="blog-image-wrapper">
            <img class="blog-image" src="../assets/images/workingcode.JPG" alt="Working Fizz buzz. A simple fix.">
            <span>Working code! Hooray!</span>
          </div>
          <p>I always thought you didn't need to <strong>explicity state the else statement</strong>. Turns out I was wrong! All that frustration but at least I learnt something in the end and I don't think I will make the same mistake again.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">An Elegant Solution</h3>
          <p>What made my experience all the more frustrating was how elegantly I had solved the the regular Fizz Buzz challenge.</p>
          <p>I wrote up some pseudocode, wrote my if statements in a way that made logical sense and completed the challenge after a small amount of googling. </p>
          <p>The main thing that I did to solve the problem was scrubbing up on using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arithmetic.asp">Modulus operator</a> to solve the problem.</p>
          <p>I felt pretty good when solving this problem, I had done it fairly quickly but I am sure it could be improved upon. </p>
          <p>I learnt to have a plan before starting and to understand what tools or methods (or arithmetic!) you might need.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">My Approach to Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>Here is a beautiful list of problem-solving techniques, those in bold I do more than others.</p>
          <ul class="blog-list">
            <li>Pseudocode</li>
            <li><strong>Trying something</strong></li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
            <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Console.logging</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Googling</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All of these techniques are valuable but why?</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Pseudocode</h4>
          <p>Pseudocode is great for breaking down a larger complex problem into smaller steps. It is very useful since it gives you a rough guide to solving your issue.</p>
          <p>I feel confident using this technique but I have to remind myself to use it. Often I will rush into <em>solve mode</em> without fulling considering the problem. You can easily get stuck this way and maybe go down a path you wouldn't of if you planned your solution in the beginning!</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Trying something</h4>
          <p>Ahh yes. My favourite technique, perhaps not the most elegant or sophisticated but I think it is a great way to learn.</p>
          <p>You quickly figure out if something works or not with this method. Try not to be a monkey on a typewriter with this method, have an understanding of <strong>why</strong> something might work before you try it.</p>

            <span>Vigiante Duck.</span>
          </div>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Rubber Ducky method</h4>
          <p>A method I use when I am super stuck on an issue except I talk to my partner who has 0 knowledge of coding.
          Sometimes she will get frustrated with me because she thinks I expect an answer from her. Sorry Katelyn!</p>
          <p>It is very useful because you talk about the problem in plain language and often solve the problem as you are saying it! </p>
          <p>I didn't actually know this technique had a name, despite having used it many times. Perhaps I should talk to an inanimate object instead though. <strong>Relationship Advice 101</strong>. </p>
          
          <h4 class="minor-header">Reading Error Messages and Googling</h4>
          <p>These two go hand in hand for me. If the error message is simple to understand then usually I will be able to pinpoint the issue in my code. If it is long and complex I will often copy and paste the error message which will return a result.</p>
          <p>Every issue you come across, someone has probably already experienced it. Google is amazing for problem solving, <strong>this is the bread and butter of a Web Developer</strong>.</p>

          </div>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Console Logging</h4>
          <p>A useful technique that I use often. It is great for understanding when functions run in your control flow and for testing functions in general.</p>
          <p>It is also very useful for debugging. For example, when you are trying to figure out what type of data a parameter is, <strong>console.log(typeof yourvariable )</strong> is super useful in these situations.</p>
          
          <h4 class="minor-header">Ask your peers/coaches for help</h4>
          <p>Another technique I use infrequently, often when I am super stuck and I haven't been able to make much progress on my own.</p>
          <p>This technique is useful because your peers can provide you direction and help you consider a solution that you might not think of on your own. Be sure to come with what you have tried as this will help with problem solving.</p>
          <p><strong>Do not be afraid or ashamed to ask for help! People are a lot kinder than they appear</strong>.</p>

            <span>Where I'd like to reflect.</span>
          </div>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Improving your process with reflection</h4>
          <p>A technique I use after solving a difficult problem. I think it is important to take a step back and say "Okay, what went well, what went wrong and what could I do better next time?</p>
          <p>Reflection will make your next encounter with a similar problem much easier as we can pull from our wisdom and previous experience.</p>
          <p>I would also encourage reflection <strong>when things go well</strong>. This is not something I do often but it can be useful in reinforcing positive habits and processes.</p>
