          <p>Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains are malleable and can change through the reorganisation of our neurons.</p>
          <p>This is an empowering idea as it suggests that we are capable of learning and growing throughout our life. Our brain and our abilities are not fixed but have the potential to grow and become better.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">How can we benefit from Neuroplasticity?</h3>
          <p>The key idea of Neuroplasticity is that repetition of an activity groups neurons together which shape themselves according to that activity.</p>
          <p>Each time we practice a task, it causes different neurons to fire together which strengthens these connections in our brain. Over time and with repeated practice these connections grow stronger and stronger.</p>
          <p>As these connections grow, our ability to perform the task we are learning becomes easier. This growth reorganises our brain and makes it more capable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>There are many ways that we can support neuroplasticity to allow ourselves to learn, develop new skills and form memories.</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Sleep</h4>
          <p>Getting enough and a regular amount of sleep is <a href="https://www.mhealthknowledge.org/sleep-disorders/neuroplasticity-and-sleep.html">critical to neuroplasticity</a>. Sleep allows our brains to reset and repair and is crucial in improving various learning and memory tasks.</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Diet</h4>
          <p>A diet which is rich in magnesium and omega-3 fats can also help support neuroplasticity. 
          Magnesium has been shown to increase plasticity in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26282667/ ">visual cortex of mice while omega-3 enhances neurogensis in the hippocampus and synaptic plasticity.</a> </p>
          <p>It is better to get these vitamins and minerals from food compared to pills. Foods such as fish, avocado and nuts like almonds and cashews are perfect for supporting this growth</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Seek Novel Experiences</h4>
          <p>Trying something new is a perfect way to support neural growth. Novel experiences  gets our brain working as it encounters something unfamiliar. As our brain engages with this experience it starts to build new neural pathways. </p>
          <p> Try visiting a city or country you haven't been to before or try brushing your teeth with your left hand, you'll realise how difficult it is!
            Get out of auto-pilot and try something new.
            </p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">A Practical Guide to Boosting Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>If you are looking to boost your neuroplasticty then I recommend checking out <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/teach-and-learn-better-with-a-neuroplasticity-super-protocol/">Andrew Hubermans blog</a>. He has great content on the brain and body in general and his 'Neuroplasticity Super Protocol' is a great guide to learning and teaching better.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>Growth Mindset is the idea that your capabilities and talents can improve over time. We are not fixed, this isn't always how it has to be, we can get better, improve and grow.</p>
          <p>A Growth Mindset is important because it can reduce our self-limiting beliefs and encourage us to embrace challenges and persist when we face great difficulties. We may fail but we are not a failure, we can always rise above and do more than we thought we could.</p>

          <p>I have heard a lot about growth mindset over the last few years and I think it is a really important idea. People can be fixated on thinking that they are one way or another and that they have to be that way forever. I am surprised that some people think this way, that we are static and incapable of growth.</p>
          

          <p>I will integrate Growth Mindset into my learning journey by reminding myself that it is normal to face challenges and difficulties.</p>
          <p>I do my best to adapt a Growth Mindset through positive self talk and encouraging myself to try as hard as I can. I find encouragement when I realise that I am better than I was before, that hard work and persistence pays off.</p>
          <p>This is noticeable in the gym when I can move more weight that I previously could or when I solve a coding problem that I initially thought I couldn't solve.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Growth Mindset Explained</h3>
          <p>See below for another interesting resource I've come across featuring Andrew Huberman. Huberman is great at communicating complex science in simple digestible terms.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Going Forward</h3>
          <p>As I continue my learning journey, I plan to prioritse my sleep more by making sure it is more consistent. I have been reminded about the importance of sleep through this deep dive and realised how important it is for growth.</p>
          <p>I will also continue to develop a Growth Mindset and remind myself of this when I face obstacles I don't think I can conquer.</p>
