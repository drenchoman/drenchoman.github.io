          <p>Five weeks have flown by and I have arrived at the end of Foundations. It is time to sit back and reflect.</p>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Mindfulness and Awareness</h4>
          <p>A daily mindfulness practice has helped me to be more aware of my thoughts and ways of thinking. It has been interesting to get to know myself in this way.</p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">Breaking Down Problems</h4>
          <p>I have a better understanding of how I problem solve. I am now able to break down problems into smaller chunks which become more solveable. </p>
          <h4 class="minor-header">How to listen better</h4>
          <p>I have learnt to be a better listener. The listening and looping exercises showed me how distracted I can get. I am aware that I need to reduce distractions and focus on the person when I am listening. This way I will better understand the person.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
          <p>I think that having an awareness of your weaknesses, strengths, and values is critical to learning. If you know what you don't know then you become more open to learning.
          </p>
          <p>Having a growth mindset is also a value that can boost your learning as it makes you open to growth and opportunity. We all have the capacity to learn and grow and become better.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What has suprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>My biggest suprise was getting to understand myself better in the Identity, Values and Strengths activity.</p>
          <p>It was an interesting activity and I got to write down thoughts that were floating around in my head somewhere but had never been expressed. I feel like I now have a better understanding of where my values and identity comes from.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>The most challenging aspects were writing down my learnings each week into a blog post. I found it difficult to distill a bunch of newly learnt material into easy to read, digestable blog posts.</p>
          <p>I feel like I did an OK job ultimately but I feel like some of my writing was poor and hard to understand due to a lack of explanation.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a Web Development Bootcamp course?</h3>
          <p>I think it is because Dev Academy understands that being a well rounded individual is important to success in the tech industry and life in general. </p>
          <p>It is not only about being technically proficent but having a good mindset, attitude and being able to understand and work well with others. More can be acheived by working with others compared to working alone.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Does the time you spent studing core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?</h3>
          <p>I think the core material has been very useful in helping me become a more well rounded individual. It has helped me to get a better understanding about myself, how I think, how I learn and how I work with others.</p>
          <p>I believe that these "soft skills" are very important in work and life in general as they enable cooperation with others which can often achieve a better result compared to working alone.</p>
          <p>Knowing tech skills is also important but the tech industry can change very quickly and the skills that are important can also change.</p>
          <p>This is why it is important to understand yourself so you can learn, reflect, adapt and grow. Once you understand yourself you tackle any challenge. </p>
