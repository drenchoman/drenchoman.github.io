          <h2 class="blog-major-title">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p class="bootcamp">My long term goal remains the same- to become a Fullstack Web Developer.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I am more interested in become a generalist than a specialist which is why a smaller company would suit me better as you generally have your time split amongst multiple areas.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I don't have a particular destination in mind. I just want to be able to do my work well and to a high standard in a supportive team. </p>


          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p class="bootcamp">My discipline remains my strength as I approach Bootcamp. I have been consistent with my progress throughout foundations which has helped incredibly with my learning.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I am really looking forward to getting out of the house each day as I think this will help my discipline further with activites outside of coding (daily exercise especially!). </p>
          <p class="bootcamp">One strength I have started to develop is my problem solving ability. Being able to break a large problem down into smaller, solveable chunks. This strength has been very useful, especially during the JS carnival challenges.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I think these strengths will be very important during Bootcamp as we will be learning a lot and we will be overwhelmed with information. My discipline will help me to persist in the face of the difficulty while my problem solving strength will help me to break down these problems when they seem large and overwhelming.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">My biggest limitation will be my communication skills as I know I can be quite reserved. This will hinder effectively collaboration so I will do my best to improve this while at Bootcamp.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p class="bootcamp">My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp is likely to be public speaking.
            I am not very confident in my public speaking ability but I am weirdly looking forward to learning and becoming better at it. </p>
           <p class="bootcamp">I think this is an important skill to develop so I want to get beyond the idea that I am not a public speaker and perhaps with time I will become one.
           </p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What non-technical skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p class="bootcamp">The non-technical skills that I would like to develop has not changed since my first learning plan.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I would still like to improve communication skills, my speaking and listening skills specifically. Ultimately I want to be able to work more effectively in a team environment so I want to be able to better understand my teammates</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I would also like to improve my public speaking skills by taking opportunities to share my work in front of others.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p class="bootcamp">I expect the Bootcamp team to function pretty similarly to the Foundations team. I expect them to be helpful and guiding when I am faced with a problem that I am having trouble with.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I do not expect the Bootcamp team to give me the answer when asked but to give me information and guide me in the right direction.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
          <p class="bootcamp">I expect myself to be 100% committed to learning and growing.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I will commit a set amount of time to learning each day and use the rest of my time to relax, reflect and recover.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I will take regular breaks while at Bootcamp and will do my best to remain calm and composed, I do not want to take my frustrations out on others if I am feeling stressed.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I will treat everyone with respect this includes other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
          <p class="bootcamp">I am really looking forward to Bootcamp and I can't wait! It will be nice to be out of the house on a regular basis, I just hope it doesn't rain on my way to train station each day :)</p>

          <h2 class="blog-major-title">Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>My long term goal is to become a Fullstack web Developer.</p>
          <p>I want to be able to work fully remotely for a company or myself and perhaps live out in a small town with a tight, friendly community. Living in Auckland can feel quite isolating at times with everything so far away.</p>
          <p>Realistically, a Front-End Developer role is what I want following the course and as I become more comfortable with backend, a full-stack developer.
            I know I should always be open to different pathways though as tech is very broad and there are many directions that you can go in.</p>
          


          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h3>
          <p>My strengths are my discipline. If I have a clear goal and set plan, I will stick to it and not waiver.
            I think that is what makes a course such as Dev Academy better for me as a learner as there are deadlines and deadlines get me going.</p>
          <p>Having self-taught for 2 years, I know that I tend to fall off task because there is nothing pushing me to get the work done besides my own self imposed deadlines. 
            I still found a lot of success self-teaching but I realised that a more rigours structure outside of my control will be better for my learning.</p>
          <p>When I hit a wall with my learning I will take additional time to understand the material. If it still doesn't make sense to me after sleeping on it then I will ask for assistance before moving on.
            My experience with self-teaching is that sometimes there is material that just doesn't click until you learn something else that connects the dots. I know not to be too discouraged if I dont' understand something straight away as it may make more sense later on after learning about another topic.</p>
          

            <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>I would like to improve my speaking. I know I can be quite reserved and unwilling to share my opinion. This could be due to my percieved lack of knowledge or just thinking that what I have to say is wrong. These are some anxieties that I wish to work on throughout the course as I want to be a team member that contributes and can share his ideas.</p>
          <p>I would also like to improve my listening skills. I think I can often have what I want to say in my head before the person has even finished speaking. This means I am not truly listening. Seek first to understand, then to be understood. It is by listening that we begin to fully understand the issue at hand.</p>
          <p>Generally speaking, I want to be a valuable team member who is easy to get along and work with. I know I can be this person as I have worked well in times in the past. I just want to be that way more times than not.</p> 
          
          


          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h3>
          <p>Next week will be the first week during Foundations that I can commit 100% to the workload (just in time for Javascript!). I have been working up until this point while managing the course work.
            I now have a lot more time to utilise.</p>
          <p>I want to be more helpful in active in the discord especially when people need help. I know many people are starting from zero coding experience so I can give help in a "this is what I wish I know before I started" kind of way.</p>
          <p>A key way to managing the workload for me is to take breaks. In these breaks I want to be active, going to the gym or for a run. I am quite an active person and I know how much energy it gives me afterwards.</p>
          <p>If things begin to build up and it gets to much, I am able to drop things like soccer training and I can reduce the number of days I go the gym. I endeavour to keep these activites going though as I think it really helps with my learning, especially at the gym where I can just ponder my thoughts.</p>
          
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>If I am having trouble I will generally do my own research first by Googling. I enjoy trying to solve my own problems first. I will generally set a timer of 30 mins and If I have made no progress then I will seek help.</p>
          <p>My first point of contact would be the Discord channel, seeing if anyone is having a similar issue and if not asking for help there.</p>
          <p>If I am still having trouble I will ask a facilitator for help. The facilitators may not know everything but they will definitely lead you in the right direction with helpful links and resources or people to contact.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">What you expect from the Facilitation team </h3>
          <p>My expectations of the Facilitation team is that they are there to help guide us in the right direction. They are not there to give us the answers but to facilitate our learning. 
          </p>
          <p>This is the best way to learn as we are not relying on them as a crutch. It is important to be able to problem solve as a developer.</p>
          <h3 class="blog-sub-header">Schedule Information</h3>
